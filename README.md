# VRBangDream
VR version of Bang Dream

This is the final group project for course ELEC4547 done with @ZinerX. It is developed on Unity 2022.3.52f1 with Google Cardboard XR plugin.

The project is developed to build an apk file to Android phone and the phone displays VR content to VR glasses that are similar to Google Cardboard so this code will not work on VR glasses like Oculus nor ios platform.

## Usage
Download the apk from VRBangDreamV2022\3.apk and upload it to your Android phone. Use bluetooth or USB cable to connect your keyboard to your phone. Launch the apk and play.

You must need to use keyboard to play as this game only reads keyboard input.
